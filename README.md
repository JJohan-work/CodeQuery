## Description  
Find which programming language is for you with this short quiz.   
*This is the Epicodus Week 2 final project*   
   
*While the Quiz does take in user input for the final answer it does not accuretly point you to a recommended language*<br>

## How it works
The quiz decides one of four languages to suggest based on how the user responded to 8 questions. Each question has 4 options which corralate to adding 1 to its own index in an array (ie answer 1 will go into index 0 of the array). At the end of the questions the program looks at the array and pulls out the largest number and then shows a corralating div in the answer box.
